## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- Visual Studio Code
- axe DevTools for accessibility

### What I learned

I have always been comfortable with straight-up CSS but for this challenge I wanted to give SCSS a try.

### Continued development

I plan on continuing using SCSS through Visual Studio Code so my rendered CSS will automatically include the proper vender prefixes for all browsers.
